## About Me  
I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, with a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. My focus is on building intelligent, scalable systems that extract insight from complex data and drive decision-making.

I invite you to explore my work and see how I’ve applied these skills in real-world contexts—from image classification and anomaly detection to full-scale ETL+ML pipelines.

## Selected Highlights  
Here are some of the projects I believe best reflect my technical depth, innovation, and drive. I encourage you to click through to see code, documentation and results.

**GAN-Boosted Skin Lesion Classifier**  
Built a hybrid DCGAN + DenseNet201 architecture to synthesize 10,000 images for class balancing on the ISIC dataset, reaching 96.23% accuracy across seven classes and reducing misclassification by 20%.  
Link: `GAN-Boosted Skin Lesion Modeling` (see repository)

**FinDoc Insight Engine**  
Designed and deployed a full-stack system (Flask backend · Tesseract OCR · fine-tuned BERT · PostgreSQL · Chart.js) for processing and normalizing financial documents (receipts, statements), enabling interactive dashboards and accelerating strategic analytics by 40%.  
Link: `FinDoc Insight Engine` (see repository)

**Cognitive Supply Chain Intelligence Hub**  
Engineered an integrated workflow combining weather, news, finance and supplier KPI streams with vector-retrieval (ChromaDB), forecasting (Prophet) and anomaly detection (Isolation Forest). Delivered 30% faster disruption anticipation.  
Link: `Cognitive Supply Chain Intelligence Hub` (see repository)

**Risk Surveillance Grid**  
Architected an AWS-native (MSK, EMR, S3, Lambda, Redshift, Airflow) streaming ETL + ML pipeline using PySpark and K-Means clustering to reduce false-positives by 25% and increase threat-recognition precision in real-time transaction processing.
